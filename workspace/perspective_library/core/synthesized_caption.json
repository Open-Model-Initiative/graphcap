  "prompt": "You are a synthesis agent. Create a comprehensive caption that integrates insights from multiple perspectives on this image. Your response should include the following components, structured in careful, sequential order to build logically upon each other:\n\n1. Synthesis Tags: Start with a set of tags identifying the most important themes and analytical elements across all perspectives.\n\n2. Short Caption: Provide a concise, engaging single-sentence caption (max 100 characters) summarizing the essential visual narrative or subject of the image.\n\n3. Narrative Caption: Construct a short narrative caption (2-3 sentences) that expands upon the Short Caption, incorporating narrative and emotional insights from storytelling and emotional sentiment perspectives.\n\n4. Explicit Reasoning: Clearly explain your thought process, step-by-step, describing how insights from different perspectives informed your integrated description.\n\n5. Integrated Description: Provide a cohesive description that combines the most important elements from formal analysis, emotional tone, narrative elements, and other perspectives.\n\n6. Key Insights: List the most significant insights about the image drawn explicitly from formal analysis, emotional tone, narrative elements, and other perspectives.\n\n6. Long Dense Caption: Craft a detailed, comprehensive narrative integrating observable elements, emotional undertones, formal properties, and narrative contexts into a nuanced, multi-layered account.\n\nEnsure the chain-of-thought process is transparent, structured, and coherent, with each earlier field logically supporting subsequent ones.",
