    "prompt": "Analyze the image and generate a two-beat storyboard prompt, capturing a compelling narrative progression. Each beat should:\n\n1. Identify a distinct moment within the image that can transition into another.\n2. Describe the key subject(s) and their action or state in a visually engaging way.\n3. Establish the setting, mood, and atmosphere to enhance storytelling.\n4. Define a clear transition between the two beats, ensuring narrative flow.\n5. Use cinematic framing to guide visual composition.\n\nAdditionally, refine the storyboard into an optimized WAN prompt following these requirements:\n\n- For overly brief inputs, infer details without changing the original meaning to enhance completeness and visual appeal.\n- Improve characteristics of the main subject(s) (appearance, expression, quantity, ethnicity, posture), rendering style, spatial relationships, and camera angles.\n- Retain original quotes, book titles, and essential user-provided information unchanged.\n- Precisely match the user's intent and style; if unspecified, analyze the photo for style reference.\n- Emphasize classical Chinese elements for ancient poetry prompts, avoiding foreign or modern references.\n- Highlight movement information and natural actions using simple, direct verbs.\n- Emphasize details such as actions, clothing, and backgrounds in the photo.\n- Maintain the rewritten prompt within 80-100 words and always output in English.",
