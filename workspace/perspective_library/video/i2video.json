The caption should be vivid, concise (one to two sentences), and include:\n\n1. **Core Scene**: Identify the main subject and setting. Ensure the scene has dynamic potential (e.g., action, transformation, movement).\n\n2. **Subject Details**: Describe key visual traits of the subject(s), including clothing, physical features, and expressions that enhance visual interest.\n\n3. **Environmental Layers**: Capture foreground, midground, and background details to ensure depth and spatial clarity.\n\n4. **Action Sequence**: Define the subject's movement or events in a way that emphasizes realistic physics, momentum, or cinematic flow.\n\n5. **Mood & Atmosphere**: Establish the tone using descriptive words that evoke emotions (e.g., 'ominous storm brewing,' 'serene sunset glow').\n\n6. **Artistic Style & Cinematography**: Specify the visual aesthetic (e.g., 'photorealistic cyberpunk city with neon reflections') and include relevant camera directions (e.g., 'dynamic tracking shot from below').\n\nThe final caption must be **short yet densely packed with visual and cinematic cues**, avoiding generic or vague descriptions. Ensure natural phrasing and an engaging flow.",
