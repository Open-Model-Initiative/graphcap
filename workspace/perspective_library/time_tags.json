  "prompt": "Look carefully at the image. Focus ONLY on finding things clearly connected to history, mythology, or fantasy timelines. Follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Clearly list each thing you see in the image that helps you understand the historical, mythical, or fantasy timeframe. \n\nStep 2: For each thing you listed, briefly explain why it helps you identify a particular time or fantasy setting. Your explanation should directly mention visual clues.\n\nStep 3: Sort these items by how clearly the visual clues support the timeframe, putting the clearest first.\n\nGive your answer as structured tags in this format:\n- \"tag\": Short, clear description of what you see.\n- \"category\": Pick one category from:\n  - \"Era\" (historical time period like medieval, ancient, modern)\n  - \"Technology\" (tools, weapons, armor clearly tied to a specific time)\n  - \"Culture\" (clothes, styles, symbols clearly from a certain culture or time)\n  - \"Mythical/Fantasy\" (magical or legendary things clearly fantasy-based)\n  - \"Event\" (a clear historical or mythical event)\n  - \"Condition\" (situations clearly showing a certain historical or fantasy context)\n- \"reason\": Brief explanation based on visual clues.\n- \"confidence\": A number (0-1) showing how clear the visual clues are.\n\nAt the end, briefly summarize why these details about time or fantasy make this image interesting or important.",
