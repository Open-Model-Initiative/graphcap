### Is your feature request related to a problem?
Currently, our layout does not provide a dedicated, space-efficient place to manage feature toggles (flags), quickly test server connections (e.g., media server, graphcap server), or view workspace files. Users need quick access to these common configuration and debugging features without navigating away from the primary layout. Additionally, the main layout doesn't yet account for sidebar-style elements, which can lead to awkward or overlapping layouts when implementing future panels.

### Describe the solution you'd like
Implement collapsible **side action panels** (also known as sidebars or utility drawers) on both the left and right edges of the interface:

#### **Left Side Panel:**
This panel will primarily handle global **feature flags and settings**, specifically:
- Relocate the existing **feature flag toggles** into this left-side utility drawer, organizing them neatly into compact, categorized toggle switches.
- Each toggle should clearly indicate its function through labels and optional icons for readability and ease of use.

#### **Right Side Panel:**
Provide access to advanced configuration options and server controls. This panel will include the following sections:

- **Server Connections**
  - Actions to set up and test connectivity to:
    - **Media Server**
    - **GraphCap Server**
  - Display clear connection statuses (Connected, Error, Testing...) next to each server.

- **File Browser**
  - A compact file explorer/list view of the `/workspace` directory.
  - Basic functionality to browse files and folders, view file information, and potentially open or select files directly.

#### **Panel Interaction & UI Requirements:**
- Both panels should slide in/out upon user interaction.
- Incorporate intuitive expand/collapse controls (icons or narrow tab handles).
- Automatically integrate with the layout calculations for the main content area width:
  - When panels are expanded, the main layout dynamically adjusts width accordingly.
  - Layout recalculations should smoothly animate and feel responsive.
- Include persistent states (collapsed/open) saved in local storage or user preferences.
- Design with compact, professional styling consistent with current UI:
  - Minimalist design: subtle shadow, minimal padding, compact spacing, clean typography.
  - Dark mode-friendly color scheme, matching existing application aesthetic.
- The right-side panel should additionally include:
  - **File Browser:** List contents of the `/workspace` directory, allowing easy access and management of workspace files directly within the UI.

### **Summary of UI Component Requirements:**
- **Responsive Side Panels:** Left and right panels dynamically expand/collapse.
- **Width Calculation Integration:** Adjust main layout width to accommodate open/closed states of side panels seamlessly.
- **Left Panel:**  
  - Move existing "Feature Flags" into this panel.
- **Right Side Panel:**  
  - Connection setup actions (Media Server, GraphCap Server).
  - File browser for `/workspace` directory.
- **Compact Visual Styling:** Minimal padding, clear typography, sleek icons, and compact overall dimensions to maintain professional look.

This will significantly enhance functionality, improve visual structure, and streamline workflow efficiency for users managing multiple interactions within the app.
