# Feature Request: 
### Is your feature request related to a problem?
I wish graphcap could provide perspective captions through a REST API because we need to access these capabilities from the frontend UI without embedding the Python code directly.

### Describe the solution you'd like
Add REST API endpoints to the existing server that allow:
- `GET /api/v1/perspectives/list` - List all available perspectives
- `POST /api/v1/perspectives/caption` - Generate a caption for an image using a specified perspective

The API should accept image URLs or base64-encoded images and return structured JSON responses with caption data.

### Alternatives Considered
- Using WebSockets for real-time updates
- Implementing a GraphQL endpoint
- Creating a separate microservice

### Additional Context
This will enable the frontend UI to leverage the perspective caption functionality without requiring direct access to the Python codebase.
