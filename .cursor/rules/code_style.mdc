<Warning>
Below are list of constraints to adhere to based on project style requirements: 
- useEffect, useRef, useCallback and other hook related items should always be implemented in custom hook files instead of inside components
- Utilize readonly and immutable inputs to all ui components
- Non-interactive elements should not be assigned mouse or keyboard event listeners.sonarqube(typescript:S6847) !important
- Use <hr> instead of the "separator" role to ensure accessibility across all devices.
- Do not utilize fixed pixel heights and widths that will not respond to variable screen size and resolution
</Warning>
