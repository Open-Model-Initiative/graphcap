Datasets
==============

This guide will help you manage a dataset in the Graphcap UI. 

Creating a New Dataset
----------------------

1. Visit ``localhost:32300`` to access the Graphcap web interface.

2. Click on the ``Gallery`` link on the right side. The Gallery defaults to the Carousel View and the ``os_img`` Dataset. 

3. On the left side of the Gallery screen, next to Datasets, click on the ``New Dataset`` button. A ``Create New Dataset`` window will popup.

4. Type in the name of the dataset and press the ``Create dataset`` button. Use only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. This will create a folder in the ``workspace/datasets/local`` folder, and this location will be referenced in future steps.

If you need to cancel out of creating the dataset, click the ``Cancel`` button in the popup to return to the Gallery screen.

Deleting a Dataset
------------------

1. In the Gallery screen, either hover over or select the dataset you wish to delete.

2. Click on the "hamburger" menu (the three vertical dots) that appear on the dataset. A small dialogue option will appear with ``Delete Dataset``.

3. Click on ``Delete Dataset``. A separate "Delete Dataset" window will popup, asking for you to confirm deletion of the dataset.

4. To confirm deletion, click the ``Delete Dataset`` button in the popup.

If you need to cancel the deletion, click the ``Cancel`` button in the popup to return to the Gallery screen.

Adding Images to a Dataset
---------------------------------

1.  Select the dataset where you want to add images. The Image Editor will open in the center of the Gallery window.

In a blank dataset, "No images found" will be shown, with a button to upload images. With a dataset that already contains images, you will see the first image in the dataset in Carousel View, or thumbnails of images in the Grid View.

2. Click on the ``Upload`` button. A system window will popup, allowing you to select one or multiple images. 

3. Select the image or images to upload, and click ``Open``.

Deleting Images from a Dataset
------------------------------

1. In either Carousel View or Grid View, select the image to delete.

2. In the top right of the Image Editor, click the trashcan icon to delete the image.

Editing Images in a Dataset
---------------------------

1. In either Carousel View or Grid View, select the image to edit.

2. In the top right of the Image Editor, click the pencil icon. This will bring the selected image into a dedicated space for editing.

3. Click the ``Edit`` button to edit the image. 

This will reveal a cropping tool overlay on the selected image. You can click and drag the image to select what is cropped before saving.

There are also controls at the bottom of the Image Editor for Zoom and Rotate. Zoom will allow you to zoom in or out on your image. Rotate will rotate your image 90 degrees in either direction.

4. To cancel your changes or save your changes, click the ``Cancel`` or ``Save`` buttons, respectively.

5. Click the ``Close`` button to exit out of the space and return to the Gallery.
