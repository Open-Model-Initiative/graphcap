Perspectives in graphcap
===========================

Think of a perspective as a unique way of looking at and describing an image. Just like how a photographer, an art critic, and a child might describe the same photograph differently, graphcap uses different perspectives to capture various aspects of what makes an image meaningful.

What's in a Perspective?
=======================

At its core, a perspective is about asking specific questions about an image. For example:

- What objects and relationships can we see? (Graph Caption)
- How does the composition work? (Art Critic)
- What feelings does it evoke? (Emotional Sentiment)
- What story does it tell? (Storytelling)
- What poetic metaphors might arise? (Poetic Metaphor)
- How does this image relate to time? (Temporarium)

Each perspective has its own:

- **Focus**: what it looks for in the image
- **Language**: how it describes what it sees
- **Structure**: how it organizes information
- **Balance**: between describing what's visible and interpreting meaning
- **Module**: which family of perspectives it belongs to
- **Tags**: categories that help organize and find perspectives

The Perspective Ecosystem
========================

Perspectives in graphcap are organized into modules that group related perspectives together. This organization makes it easier to:

- Find perspectives relevant to your interests
- Enable or disable entire families of perspectives
- Understand relationships between similar perspectives

Examples of modules include:

- **Core**: Essential perspectives like Graph Caption and Custom Caption
- **Artistic**: Art Critic, Poetic Metaphor, and other artistic interpretations
- **Narrative**: Storytelling and related perspectives
- **Technical**: Specialized analytical perspectives
- **Synthesizer**: Perspectives that combine multiple captions into a focused output.

Built-in Perspectives
===================

graphcap comes with a diverse set of built-in perspectives, each designed for specific use cases:

Graph Caption
------------
The "just the facts" perspective that captures objective elements:

- Objects and their relationships
- Clear, verifiable descriptions
- Confidence scores for each observation
- Both quick summaries and detailed breakdowns

Example output:
"A brown dog sitting next to a red ball on green grass" (with confidence scores and relationship mapping)

Art Critic
---------
The formal analysis perspective for visual arts:

- Composition and framing
- Color relationships
- Technical execution
- Artistic choices

Example output:
"Strong diagonal composition with warm earth tones, emphasizing texture through shallow depth of field"

Emotional Sentiment
-----------------
The feeling-focused perspective:

- Mood and atmosphere
- Emotional impact
- Human elements
- Psychological aspects

Example output:
"A serene moment capturing the quiet joy of a peaceful afternoon"


Working with Perspectives
=======================

Discovering and Selecting
------------------------
graphcap offers an intuitive way to browse and select perspectives:

- Browse by module to find related perspectives
- Filter by tags to find perspectives for specific needs
- Search by name or description
- View detailed descriptions to understand what each perspective offers

Combining Perspectives
--------------------
Perspectives work best when they complement each other. You might use:

- Graph Caption + Art Critic for detailed artwork analysis
- Emotional Sentiment + Temporarium for storytelling
- Multiple perspectives for training data generation

Local Development and Customization
=================================

graphcap allows you to create and test new perspectives locally before sharing them more broadly:

Perspective Workspace
-------------------
Your perspective library can include both:

- Standard perspectives from the graphcap library
- Local perspectives you're developing or customizing

This separation lets you experiment with new ideas while keeping the main system stable.

Creating Your Own Perspective
===========================

Before You Start
--------------
Ask yourself:

- What unique angle are you trying to capture?
- Who will use this perspective and why?
- How literal vs. interpretative should it be?
- What kind of output will be most useful?
- Which module does it belong to?
- What tags would help users find it?

How to Create a Perspective
--------------------------

Every perspective is defined by:

1. **Basic Information**:
   - Name and display name
   - Version
   - Description
   - Module assignment
   - Tags for categorization
   - Priority level

2. **Prompt**:
   Clear instructions for how to analyze the image

3. **Schema**:
   The structured fields that will contain the analysis

4. **Presentation**:
   How the results will be displayed

5. **Context Template**:
   How the perspective's output can be used in broader contexts

Tips for Good Perspectives
========================

Keep It Focused
-------------
- Pick one main thing to analyze well
- Don't try to do everything
- Be clear about what the perspective is and isn't for

Example: A "street_scene" perspective might focus on urban design elements, but leave artistic analysis to the art critic perspective.

Quality Matters
-------------
- Test with diverse images
- Check if outputs are useful
- Get feedback from potential users
- Have clear ways to measure success

Make It Discoverable
------------------
- Place it in the appropriate module
- Use descriptive tags
- Write a clear, concise description
- Consider including example outputs in the description

Evolution and Deprecation
-----------------------
As your needs evolve, perspectives can too:

- Update existing perspectives with new versions
- Mark outdated perspectives as deprecated
- Suggest replacement perspectives when deprecating old ones

Real-World Usage
==============

graphcap perspectives are designed to be useful in real-world applications:

- **Content Creation**: Generate rich, varied descriptions for creative projects
- **Accessibility**: Provide detailed image descriptions for visually impaired users
- **Data Analysis**: Extract structured information from visual content
- **Education**: Teach different ways of seeing and analyzing visual material
- **Creative Inspiration**: Generate diverse interpretations to spark new ideas

Remember: The goal isn't to replace human understanding, but to provide useful, structured ways of describing and analyzing images for different purposes.
